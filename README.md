# Kanban Board
This project is a Kanban board implemented using **React.js**, allowing users to manage and visualize tasks based on their status, assigned users, and priority levels. Additionally, the application provides features for ordering tasks based on their title and priority.

## Features

1. **Status-based Grouping**: The Kanban board allows users to group tasks based on their status. This provides a clear overview of the current state of tasks, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

2. **User-based Grouping**: Users have the option to group tasks by the assigned user. This feature enhances collaboration and allows team members to quickly identify tasks assigned to them or their colleagues.

3. **Priority-based Grouping**: The application supports grouping tasks by priority, allowing users to focus on high-priority tasks and efficiently manage their work.

4. **Ordering by Title and Priority**: The Kanban board offers the flexibility to order tasks based on their titles or priority levels. This feature enables users to organize tasks in a way that suits their workflow.
